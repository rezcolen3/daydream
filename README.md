# That Mysterious Guy

An interactive story game where you are broke and need to sacrifice to **That Mysterious Guy** to get your wishes.

## Description

That Mysterious Guy is a interactive story game, it was made for scrapyard delhi with the theme: "Sacrifices Must be made".

We originally got inspiration from [Adventures With Anxiety](https://ncase.me/anxiety/), we thought that instead of the Anxiety fighting with the human. why not the human sacrifice to something.

Thus we decided to make this. it is set in the scene where the player is in a broke situation and he needs money. suddenly A Mysterious Guy appears in front of them and decides to offer him things like luck, money, success, fame, and more... but the player must sacrifice something for it.
